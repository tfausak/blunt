# [Blunt][]

[![Build badge][]][build]

Blunt converts between pointfree and pointful Haskell expressions. It is a web
front end to the [pointfree][] and [pointful][] libraries. While you can
install and run it locally, there's no real reason to prefer it over the
`pointfree` and `pointful` executables.
